Adding the following unnamed symmetry breaking constraints:
    such that
        and([sched .<= transform([q1], sched) | q1 : permutation of Team]),
        and([sched .<= transform([q2], sched) | q2 : permutation of Week]),
        and([sched .<= transform([q3], sched)
                 | q3 : permutation of Period])
