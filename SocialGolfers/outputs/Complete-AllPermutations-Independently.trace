Adding the following unnamed symmetry breaking constraints:
    such that
        and([sched .<= transform([q1], sched)
                 | q1 : permutation of Golfers]),
        and([sched .<= transform([q2], sched)
                 | q2 : permutation of Weeks]),
        and([sched .<= transform([q3], sched)
                 | q3 : permutation of Groups])
